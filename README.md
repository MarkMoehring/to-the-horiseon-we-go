# Horiseon Refactor Challenge

## Description

This challenge is a project which demonstrates our ability to refactor code to identify errors, streamline code, and improve semantic html to accessibility standards, thus optimizing it for search engines, and offering a more user-friendly experience!

## Come see for yourself :dash:

Visit the live site!: <https://markmoehring.github.io/to-the-horiseon-we-go/>

When you get there, you'll find properly labeled elements, alt"" tags, and descending <h1>-<h3> tags, making it easier for those using assistive technologies to navigate and understand the flow of the website.

Please enjoy!
