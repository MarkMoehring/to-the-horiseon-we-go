# Horiseon Refactor Challenge

## Description

This challenge is a project which demonstrates our ability to refactor code to identify errors, streamline code, and improve semantic html to accessibility standards, thus optimizing it for search engines, and offering a more user-friendly experience!

## Come see for yourself :dash:

When you get there, you'll find properly labeled elements, alt"" tags, and descending "h" tags, making it easier for those using assistive technologies to navigate and understand the flow of the website.

Check out some of the improvements highlighted below:
